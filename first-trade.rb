### Here is what the response looked like.

# {
#   "ok": true,
#   "symbol": "HOGE",
#   "venue": "FOOEX",
#   "direction": "buy",
#   "originalQty": 100,
#   "qty": 0,
#   "price": 25000,
#   "orderType": "limit",
#   "id": 6408,
#   "account": "HB61251714",
#   "ts": "2015-08-18T04:00:08.340298024+09:00",
#   "fills": [
#     {
#       "price": 5960,
#       "qty": 100,
#       "ts": "2015-08-18T04:00:08.340299592+09:00"
#     }
#   ],

# }

# As we can see, I got 100 fills of the 100 shares I ordered.  Whee!
# This order is now closed (open: false).
